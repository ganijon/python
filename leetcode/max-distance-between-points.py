Leetcode 3464. Maximize the Distance Between Points on a Square

You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at 
(0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.

You are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, 
where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.

You need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between 
any two points is maximized.

Return the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.

The Manhattan Distance between two cells (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) is |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
